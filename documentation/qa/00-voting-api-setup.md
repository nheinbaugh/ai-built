# Voting API Setup QA

## Requirements
- Create a new Express application using NX
- Configure TypeScript
- Add appropriate project tags
- Implement basic Express setup
- Include health check endpoint

## Implementation Verification

### Project Structure
1. Verify the project exists in the correct location:
   ```bash
   ls apps/my-voting-api
   ```
   Should show the project files and folders

### Project Tags
1. Check project.json contains the correct tags:
   ```bash
   cat apps/my-voting-api/project.json
   ```
   Should show tags: ["scope:feature", "layer:domain", "type:app"]

### Express Setup
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   nx serve my-voting-api
   ```

2. Test the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```
   Should return a JSON response with:
   - status: "healthy"
   - timestamp: current ISO timestamp
   - uptime: server uptime in seconds

## Security Considerations
- Helmet middleware added for security headers
- CORS configured
- Error handling prevents leak of system information
- JSON parsing limits in place

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal middleware stack
- Health check endpoint is lightweight
- Error handling is efficient
