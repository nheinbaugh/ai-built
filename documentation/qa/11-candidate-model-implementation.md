Candidate Model Implementation
----------------------------

## Requirements
- Implement a type-safe Candidate model with validation
- Support model creation and validation
- Ensure data integrity through validation
- Provide test utilities for candidate data

## Automated Tests
- [x] Test Coverage Requirements
  * Minimum 95% coverage for all validation logic
  * 100% coverage for type guards and factory methods
  * *Expected Result*: Coverage thresholds met with no critical paths uncovered

- [x] Candidate Validation Tests
  * Test creating candidates with valid data
  * Test validation failures for:
    - Empty name
    - Invalid party
    - Biography exceeding max length
    - Malformed image URL
  * *Expected Result*: All validation tests pass

- [x] Type Guard Tests
  * Test identifying valid candidate objects
  * Test rejecting invalid objects
  * Test handling partial candidate data
  * *Expected Result*: Type guards correctly identify valid/invalid candidates

- [x] Factory Method Tests
  * Test creating valid candidates
  * Test creating customized mock candidates
  * Test batch candidate creation
  * *Expected Result*: Factory methods produce valid candidate objects

## Manual Verification Steps
- [x] Model Creation and Validation
  * Use the factory methods to create a new candidate with valid data
  * *Expected Result*: Candidate object is created with expected fields

- [x] Validation Testing
  * Create candidate objects with:
    - Missing required fields
    - Invalid party name
    - Oversized biography
  * *Expected Result*: Validation functions return appropriate errors

- [x] Image URL Validation
  * Create candidate with valid image URL
  * Create candidate without image URL
  * Create candidate with invalid image URL
  * *Expected Result*: Validation functions handle all image URL scenarios appropriately

Note: API integration testing will be added once the API implementation is complete.
