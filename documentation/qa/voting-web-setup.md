# Voting Web Application Setup QA

## Requirements
- Create voting-web NX application
- Ensure proper project structure
- Configure appropriate NX tags
- Set up React with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Include basic layout component

## Implementation Details
The voting-web application has been created with:
- Vite-based React setup
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Basic layout component structure
- NX project tags for proper categorization

## Manual QA Steps

1. Verify Project Structure
```powershell
# Check that the project exists in the NX workspace
npx nx show project my-voting-web

# Verify the project structure exists
Get-ChildItem apps/my-voting-web/src
# Should show:
# - app/
# - components/
# - styles/
# - main.tsx
```

2. Verify Project Tags
```powershell
# Check project.json tags
Get-Content apps/my-voting-web/project.json
# Should show tags: ["scope:feature", "layer:presentation"]
```

3. Verify Development Server
```powershell
# Start the development server
npx nx serve my-voting-web

# Open browser to http://localhost:4200
# Should see the basic application running
```

4. Verify TypeScript Configuration
```powershell
# Run TypeScript check
npx nx run my-voting-web:lint

# Should complete without errors
```

5. Verify Tailwind Integration
```powershell
# Check that tailwind.config.js exists
Get-Content apps/my-voting-web/tailwind.config.js

# Verify Tailwind CSS is working by checking styles/global.css
Get-Content apps/my-voting-web/src/styles/global.css
# Should see Tailwind directives (@tailwind)
```

6. Verify Layout Component
```powershell
# Check that the layout component exists
Get-Content apps/my-voting-web/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project is listed in NX workspace
- [ ] Project has correct file structure
- [ ] Project has correct tags in project.json
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- [ ] Layout component is present and properly structured

## Notes
- Any TypeScript errors should be resolved before marking complete
- Tailwind classes should be working in the application
- Layout component should be properly exported and ready for use
